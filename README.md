# Diabetes-ML-Clustering
Unsupervised Machine Learning approach on Diabetes dataset using PCA for dimensionality reduction and KMeans for clustering. Includes data visualization and elbow method for optimal cluster selection. This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to explore the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and visualize the data, followed by KMeans clustering to group patients based on similarities in health metrics.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Used to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and visualize data in 2D while retaining most of the variance. KMeans Clustering: Applied to discover natural groupings of patients without using the outcome label. Data Visualization: Includes PCA scatter plots and Elbow curves using Seaborn and Matplotlib. This project helps in understanding how clustering techniques can reveal hidden patterns in medical data, potentially useful for early diabetes risk profiling.
